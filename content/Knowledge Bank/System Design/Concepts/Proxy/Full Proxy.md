A full proxy is similar to a [[Reverse Proxy]]. The differentiating factor being that a full proxy establishes two independent bi-directional TCP connections; one with the client and one with the server.

Such a set-up provides the full proxy with the ability to perform [[Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)]] and [[Protocol Validation]].
