A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers, handling incoming client requests and forwarding them to one or more backend servers. It then also sends the backend serverâ€™s response back to the client. It provides a layer of abstraction (by acting as the public face to incoming client requests) and helps ensure smooth flow of network traffic.

The primary goal of a reverse proxy is to:

1. Hide the identity of backend servers.

3. Enhance Security -Ensure no information about backend servers is visible outside your internal network to ensure malicious users cannot access them directly.

5. Provide additional features like [[SSL Termination]] (much like a [[Load Balancer]] would), and [[Intelligent Compression]].
