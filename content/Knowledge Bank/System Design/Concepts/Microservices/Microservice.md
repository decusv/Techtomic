Microservices are a way of building applications as a collection of small, independent services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability, and can work on its own.

## Characteristics of Microservices

- Each microservices focuses on a single business capability e.g., searching user profiles.

- Microservices are independent from each other. You can deploy multiple microservices independently of each other without affecting the whole application.

- Microservices communicate with each other via methods like APIs.

- Microservices can be built using different methods i.e., programming languages or tools best suited for the task.
