A distributed Hash Table (DHT) is a key-value store, where data is distributed across a network of nodes. DHTs hashing techniques such as the keys can be mapped to notes.

DHTs also provide mechanisms for routing requests even as nodes join and leave the network.

Some DHT Protocols include Chord and Pastry.
