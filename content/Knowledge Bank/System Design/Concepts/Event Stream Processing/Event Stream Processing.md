Event Stream Processing refers to processing a continuous stream of real-time events as they happen. These events can be anything from a user clicking a button on a website to sensor data from a device. The idea is to process these events immediately, enabling real-time insights or actions, like detecting fraud or updating a dashboard as new data arrives.

## Store Forward

**Store-Forward** is a technique where messages or events are stored temporarily before being forwarded to their destination. If the destination is not available (like a server being down), the events are stored and forwarded later. This ensures that no data is lost during downtime.

For example, a payment processing system might store transaction data if the database is temporarily unavailable and forward it once the system is back up.

## Pub/Sub

In the **Publish-Subscribe** pattern, there are publishers and subscribers. Publishers create events or messages and donâ€™t worry about who receives them. Subscribers, on the other hand, subscribe to certain types of messages. Multiple subscribers can listen to the same event.

For example, in a stock trading system, a stock price update (publisher) is sent out, and various subscribers (traders, analysts, apps) receive that update simultaneously.

## Point-to-Point

In the **Point-to-Point** messaging model, messages are sent from one sender to one specific receiver. Unlike Pub/Sub, where many receivers might get the same message, here, the message is delivered to only one recipient.

For example, in a ticketing system, when a customer service agent picks up a ticket (event), it is removed from the queue and no other agent can access that specific ticket.
