RabbitMQ is an open-source messaging broker. It helps in managing messages between services by queuing them and ensuring they are delivered to the correct service, even if the destination is [[Event Stream Processing#Store Forward|temporarily unavailable]]. 

It can manage different messaging patterns like [[Event Stream Processing#Pub/Sub|Pub/Sub]] and [[Event Stream Processing#Point-to-Point|Point-to-Point]].
