Fail-over is an availability pattern where a backup system automatically takes over when the primary system fails. It ensures system uptime and availability even in case of hardware or software failure.

**Active-passive failover**: One system is active, and the other is on standby.

**Active-active failover**: Both systems are active, sharing the load, and can take over if one fails.
