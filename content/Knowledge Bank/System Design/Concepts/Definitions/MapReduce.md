MapReduce is a method of parallel processing.  In simple terms, MapReduce is a way of having multiple workers and a master, where the master divides a large computational task into smaller pieces for workers to execute simultaneously. Once the processes are completed and the results have been returned, the master combines the results to produce an output.

Example systems that use MapReduce are Google MapReduce and Hadoop to handle massive volumes of data for efficient processing.
