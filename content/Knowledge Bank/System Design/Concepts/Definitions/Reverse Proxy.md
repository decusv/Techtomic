A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers, handling incoming client requests and forwarding them to one or more backend servers. It then also sends the backend serverâ€™s response back to the client.

The reverse proxy effectively acts as an intermediary, performing various tasks such as caching, load balancing, and security.
