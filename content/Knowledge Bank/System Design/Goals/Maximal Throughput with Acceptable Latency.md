In terms of performance objectives, a good system design should be used to achieve maximal throughput with acceptable latency.

Maximal throughput refers to processing the largest possible number of requests in a given time period. This should be done with acceptable latency. Each request should be completed within a reasonable time frame. 

High performance but low latency results in bad user experience.
