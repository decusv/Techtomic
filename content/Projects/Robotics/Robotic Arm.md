## Overview

The following is an overview of my project between February and August of 2024, where I was able to work on, and complete my 3D-printed robotic arm.

## Features and Specifications

1. 6 NEMA Stepper motors
2. Gripper servo (max weight yet untested)
3. Arduino MEGA 2560 
4. 12V 10A Power Supply
5. 3D-Printed using PLA of various colours.
6. KY-0003 Hall Effect Sensors 

## Lessons Learnt

1. Every problem can be solved with enough creativity and patience.

2. Heating up Neodymium magnets too much can demagnetize them if temperature exceeds their Curie temperature threshold.

3.  Do not print PLA if the ambient temperature is high. Heat creep can cause premature melting which may clog the printer head.

4. Ensure polarity of wires connected to a power supply is always correct before connecting this to electrical components (as that can damage them and blow them up!)

5. Ensure the wire gauge used to connect things is appropriate for both the voltage and the current passing through them.
